# KDMagic
Cleaning-tool to remove outdated KDMs

## How to use
Select the folder where your KDMs are stored and click "Scan". KDMagic will find all outdated KDM files in that folder and list them. Click an element in the list to show the timespan in which it was valid.
Next press "Delete" to delete the files. This will irreversibly delete them, not move them to the recycle bin.
