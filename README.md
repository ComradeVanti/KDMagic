# KDMagic

Cleaning-tool to remove outdated KDMs

**⚠️ Development is paused ⚠️**  
No new features will be added or bugs fixed unless requested through an issue.  
If you wish to fork this repository and continue the work, you are very welcome
to do so.

## How to use

Select the folder where your KDMs are stored and click "Scan". KDMagic will find all outdated KDM files in that folder and list them. Click an element in the list to show the timespan in which it was valid.
Next press "Delete" to delete the files. This will irreversibly delete them, not move them to the recycle bin.
